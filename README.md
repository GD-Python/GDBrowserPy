## To all GDBrowserPy users...

GD Colon has recently **shut down** the **GDBrowser API** saying
> It's slow, unreliable, and stressful on my servers  

I **totaly understand this** so...  
I was thinking maybe I should **make my own easy to use REST API** so thats what ill be doing :)   
I will also be making a **new Python API wrapper for that!**
